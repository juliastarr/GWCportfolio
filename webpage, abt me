<p>
  Hello! My name is Julia Starr. I am sixteen years old, however i will be turning seventeen on June 28th. I go to St. Francis High School and I will be a senior next year. I am a dancer and have been dancing since I was two years old. I have done ballet, tap, modern, jazz, and musical theater dance. However I have done ballet for all 16 years of my expereince, unlike the other styles. I dance at Western Ballet in Mountain View. I also love musical theater. The first musical theater show that I did was Phantom of the Opera at my school. I have loved it ever since. Since then, I have participated in Fiddler on the Roof with my school, West Side Story with my school, and Little Shop of Horrors with Peninsula Youth Theater.
